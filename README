Legal Issues
============
The ABC has sent the lawyers after the original author of Pyhton-iView,
Jeremy Visser. The background can be found at 
https://jeremy.visser.name/2012/06/iview-a-sign-of-the-times/

I have paid my 8c per day to access the ABC. The tax office never
proposed any limits on how I could use my 8c. I beleive that this
software is legal in Australia. If you come to the same conclusion
then I encourage you to clone, fork, copy, redistribute, whatever
this repo.

For more info checkout Jeremy's FAQ on the take down notice at
https://jeremy.visser.name/2012/09/python-iview-press-qanda/

This repo has been published without Jeremy's knowledge or support,
but at the end of the day it is GPL code - it will always be free
even if the ABC legal department don't want it to be.

Requirements
============

* Python 2.6 (recommended) or Python 2.5 <http://www.python.org/>
  (Some Windows users report better compatibility with Python 2.5.)
* BeautifulSoup <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>
* rtmpdump <http://lkcl.net/rtmp/>
* simplejson <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/>
  (Only for Python 2.5 users -- same functionality is built-in to Python 2.6.)

Installation
============

1. Make sure Python is installed and working.
2. Make sure BeautifulSoup is installed in Python and working.
3. Install rtmpdump. If building from source, copy rtmpdump_x86 to
   somewhere within your $PATH (e.g. /usr/local/bin).
4. If you are running Python 2.5, install simplejson.
5. Either run ./iview-cli or ./iview-gtk.

Usage
=====

Some usage examples are provided for your perusal.

This is a purely informational command, and verifies that handshaking is
working correctly.

	$ ./iview-cli --print-auth
	iView auth data:
		Token: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
		RTMP URL: rtmp://203.18.195.10/ondemand
		Unmetered: True

This can be used to view the iView programme and find the program URL:

	$ ./iview-cli --programme
	7.30 Report:
	    7.30 Report 12/01/10	(news/730report_100112.flv)
	    7.30 Report 11/01/10	(news/730report_100111.flv)
	    7.30 Report 07/01/10	(news/730report_100107.flv)
	    7.30 Report 06/01/10	(news/730report_100106.flv)
	[...]

To actually download the program, use something like the following:

	$ ./iview-cli --download news/730report_100112.flv

If rtmpdump is all set up correctly, hopefully that will download
an .flv file into your current directory, appropriately named. If it
didn't work, type "rtmpdump" or "rtmpdump_x86" and see if it does anything.
If not, install it, or put it somewhere on your $PATH.

Hacking
=======

Uh...good luck.
